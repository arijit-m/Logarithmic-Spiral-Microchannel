# Microfluidic Spiral Channel with Micropillar Array

## Overview

This repository documents the design and fabrication of a **logarithmic spiral microfluidic channel** embedded with **micropillar arrays** for **inertial, label-free particle separation**. The device leverages fluid dynamics and curvature-induced inertial forces to achieve **passive, size-based separation**‚Äîwithout requiring external fields or active control systems.

## Key Features

- **Spiral Channel Geometry:** Designed using a 100 ¬µm-wide logarithmic spiral layout to induce Dean vortices and streamline curvature.
- **Micropillar Array:** Strategically patterned pillars promote deterministic lateral displacement and enhance separation resolution.
- **Fabrication Technique:** Device patterned using **photolithography** and soft lithography methods on PDMS substrates.
- **Separation Mechanism:** Utilizes **inertial microfluidics** for efficient separation driven purely by fluid flow and geometry.

## Working Principle

Particles suspended in flow experience inertial lift and Dean drag forces within the spiral channel. The presence of micropillars enhances these effects, enabling **differential migration** of particles based on size. This results in spatial separation at the outlet without external actuation (no electric, magnetic, or optical fields required).
